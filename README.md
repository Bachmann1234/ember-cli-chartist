It's an ember-cli wrapper for [Chartist](https://github.com/gionkunz/chartist-js)

After installing this with:

```
npm install --save ember-cli-chartist
```

you will be able to do things like:

```
{{chartist-chart
  type="line"
  options=chartOpts
  data=lineChartData}}
```

in your Ember templates
